## Running locally

Make sure that you are running the right version of Node locally. You will find the required version in the `.nvmrc` file
If you are not running the same version (`node -v`) then you will need to run

``` bash
nvm install $(cat .nvmrc)
npm run rebuild
```

### Now you can run locally

``` bash
npm run dev
```

``` bash
npm run create
```

Now you can use the files created in the `dist` folder to upload into the Demo Administrator at

### Running in a docker container

``` bash
xhost +
docker-compose up --build
```
